# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

 **Time:** Wednesdays (4-5)  
**Location:** In-person (location varies, but will be agreed upon through the group chat the day of or day before) 

2. **Assistance** 
    Text groupchat and response within 24 hours. If a group member is have trouble completing a certain task, we will go over it as a group and help them out.

3. **Respect** 
We will ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority; unanimous agreement is our goal. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    Each week we will meet and discuss what our goals for the week are. Then based off these goals, we will distrubute the specific tasks as evenly as possible amongst group memebers. We will have each member volunteer to work on tasks to best match group members to deliverables they feel comfortable working on.
5. **Time Commitment** 
    Average time is 2 hours give or take. Depending on the workload and the tasks we want to accomplish that week, we can increase that to 4+ hours. Despite that being the average, it's also flexible as long as we are communicating with each other that we have prior commitments. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    We'll respectfully hear their issues with the project and work it out either through our groupchat or during our weekly meetings. One issue that may arise during our project timeline is when we have to decide whether to continue working on the project or switching to the final exam. In this instance, we can do a majority vote, but still hearing out what each of us have to say.
