# Results  

## Algorithms:  
### BFS:  
	Output
	Correctness
	What testing we did

### PageRank: 
Our PageRank works correctly, and runs in a reasonable amount of time for our entire dataset. To test the PageRank algorithm we made a few smaller example graphs, including ones with multiple connected components & checked the results against the same Algorithm implemented in python. 
Example result:
```
Here are the top 5 ranked users in this social network graph:
1: User with I.D. 828
2: User with I.D. 713
3: User with I.D. 705
4: User with I.D. 719
5: User with I.D. 805
```
