## Running code 

In the CS225 docker enviorment, in the root directory run:  
```
mkdir build 
cd build
```
To create a build directory, then run: 
```
cmake ..  
```
To initialize cmake, after this you can run: 
```
make main
./main 
```
(Todo: Replace the "make main" above with our actual entry and exectuable later)
